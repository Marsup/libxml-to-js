## v0.2.1
 * Updated the package.json file with more data.

## v0.2
 * Dropped the SAX parser in favor of maintaining the string parser. Basically it cuts the code base in half. xml2js might implement libxmljs as well, therefore nothing is really lost.

## v0.1
 * Initial release, featuring SAX and string parsers.
